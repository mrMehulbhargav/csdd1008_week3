**Learning About Linux**


## Introduction


This document covers the basics of Linux that I learned from my professor, Maziar Sojoudian. He taught us how to set up Linux using VMware, a virtual machine tool that allows us to run Linux on our existing operating systems. In this guide, I'll go over the history of Linux, some popular Linux distributions, and a few important commands. This document is part of my assignment submission.


## Section 1: Linux History
Linux was created in 1991 by **Linus Torvalds**, a student who developed the **Linux kernel**. The kernel is the core of an operating system, managing communication between hardware and software. Linus made Linux **open-source**, meaning anyone could use, modify, and share it.
Over the years, Linux has grown significantly, because many developers are using linux for development. It’s now used on a variety of devices, including servers, smartphones, and supercomputers. Linux is valued for being secure, stable, and free, with many major websites relying on it.
**Like:** Google, Facebook, AWS and Wikipedia.


## Section 2: Linux Distributions


A **Linux distribution** (or **distro**) is a version of Linux packaged with software and tools. Here are a few popular ones:


- **Ubuntu**: Great for beginners, it's user-friendly and easy to install.
- **Debian**: Known for stability, it’s commonly used on servers.
- **Fedora**: Focuses on the latest open-source technology, ideal for developers.
- **Arch Linux**: For advanced users who want complete control and customization.


Each distro offers a different experience, and the choice depends on what we need. In class, we used **Debian** because of its stability.


## Section 3: Basic Linux Commands


We learned some essential Linux commands using the terminal:


- **ls**: ls is use to will display a list of everything in the folder you are in.
- **cd**: cd is use to will take as to the "directories".
- **pwd**: pwd is use to will tell as exactly where we are in your system. .
- **mkdir**: mkdir is use to creates a new directory.
- **cp**: cp is use to copies files or directories to the home folder.
- **mv**: mv is use to moves the file to the home folder also rename the file.
- **rm**: rm is use to delete the files or directories.
- **sudo**: sudo  is use to update the software on our system.

## These commands help us to manage and navigate the Linux system efficiently.


## Conclusion
Through my lessons with Professor Maziar Sojoudian, I learned the basics of Linux, including its setup on VMware, its different distributions, and important commands. Linux is widely used in many industries, especially in IT and web development, and mastering it opens up many opportunities to get good job in IT field.
